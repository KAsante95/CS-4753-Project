									What Linguistack Exchange offers is an opportunity for non-native english speakers to learn the language in an informal, familiar environment. Before a learning plan begins, students will have the opportunity to take a pre-assesment to see where they are and how much they have to learn. This way, instructors can better plan their curricula. Students will also have a chance to track their progress not only with an instructor, but with online quizzes offered through the site. Students can also ask instructors questions outside of the one-on-one sessions through the stack exchange forum.

								<p>For native English speakers: </br> You can make a Calendar showing available times and what the per hour rate is.</p>
								<p>For learners: </br> You can make a Calendar showing available times and what per hour rate you are willing to pay.</p>
								<p>*We do not set a rate because we find it better for both parties to set their own prices and let the market decide what the value is*</p>
								<p>
									What we ultimately want is for the process of learning the English language to be less burdensome both for the student and the instructor. We want everyone to have the ability to practice speaking English with a native speaker, and thus facilitate a smoother trasition into cultures that speak the English language. We believe that LingustackExchange does exactly that. We're <i>Bringing Accessibilty to the English Language</i>
